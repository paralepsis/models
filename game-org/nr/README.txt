Slicing notes:
- 2 perimeters is fine for all but the chip cover, which arguably needs four.
- ironing on the right greeble is a nice touch
- printing card top and left greeble parts on a smooth plate will look better.
- check seams! some get placed in unfortunate spots.
  - use bottoms of chip cover, greebles.
  - use inside corners of cover and bottom.

- might need elephant foot comp on some parts?
