Slicing notes:
- 2 perimeters is fine for all but the chip cover, which arguably needs four.
- ironing on the right greeble is a nice touch, babystep 0.02mm closer to plate.
- printing card top and left greeble parts on a smooth plate will look better.
- check seams! some get placed in unfortunate spots.
  - use bottoms of chip cover, greebles.
  - use inside corners of cover and bottom.
- 0.3mm layers seems ok

- might need elephant foot comp on some parts?
